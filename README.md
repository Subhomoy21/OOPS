# OOPS
Object Oriented programming using java.
 
SOME BASIC TERMINOLOGY IN OOPS :- 👩‍💻©

1. OBJECT:
-> The Object is the real-time entity having some state and behavior. In Java, Object is
an instance of the class having the instance variables like the state of the object and
the methods as the behavior of the object. The object of a class can be created by
using the new keyword in Java Programming language.

2. CLASS:
-> A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint
from which objects are created. In short, a class is the specification or template of an
object.

3. ABSTRACTION:
-> Abstraction means hiding lower-level details and exposing only the essential and
relevant details to the users.

4. ENCAPSULATION:
-> Encapsulation is a process of wrapping of data and methods in a single unit is called
encapsulation.
In OOP, data and methods operating on that data are combined together to form a single
unit, which is referred to as a Class.

5. INHERITANCE:
-> The Inheritance is a process of obtaining the data members and methods from one
class to another class, plus can have its own is known as inheritance. It is one of the
fundamental features of object-oriented programming.
Inheritance - IS-A relationship between a superclass and its subclasses.
Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as a superclass (or a base class
or a parent class).
Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as a subclass(or a derived class,
extended class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to
the superclass fields and methods.

6. POLYMORPHISM:
-> The process of representing one form in multiple forms is known as Polymorphism.
Different definitions of Polymorphism are:
1. Polymorphism let us perform a single action in different ways.
2. Polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple
implementations
3. We can create functions or reference variables which behaves differently in a different
programmatic context.
4. Polymorphism means many forms.
